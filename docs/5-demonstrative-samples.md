# Demonstrative Samples

The library includes two illustrative examples utilizing the foremost multiplatform navigation libraries: [Voyager](https://voyager.adriel.cafe/) and [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose)

- [Voyager sample](https://github.com/theolm/Rinku/tree/main/samples/voyager)
- [Decompose sample](https://github.com/theolm/Rinku/tree/main/samples/decompose)

*Note: Only the Voyager sample includes an iOS application. Nonetheless, the setup for Decompose would mirror that of Voyager.*

*Note 2: Both examples are using Compose multiplatform.*
